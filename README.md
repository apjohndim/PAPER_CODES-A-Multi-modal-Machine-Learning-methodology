# PaperCode-A-Multi-modal-Machine-Learning-methodology

This study explores a multi-modal machine learning-based approach to classify solitary pulmo-nary nodules (SPNs). Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), presenting primarily as SPNs, is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Early detection and appropriate management of SPNs are critical to improving patient outcomes, necessitating efficient diagnostic methodolo-gies. While CT and PET scans are pivotal in the diagnostic process, their interpretation remains prone to human error and delays in treatment implementation. This study proposes a machine learning-based multi-modal network to mitigate these concerns, integrating CT, PET and manu-ally extracted features. A comparative analysis between this model and existing literature shows improved accuracy in SPN malignancy classification. The XGBoost model simplifies diagnostic complexity, identifying VGG19 predictions from CT and PET images, SUVmax, and diameter as key malignancy predictors. Despite this study's considerable progress, it encourages further re-search to validate findings, identify additional features, and refine the multi-modal approach for broad-scale clinical implementation.
